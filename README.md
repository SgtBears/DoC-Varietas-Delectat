# DoC-Varietas-Delectat
Module for [Dawn of Civilization](https://github.com/dguenms/Dawn-of-Civilization): civilization specific unit and city art.

## Overview

[Varietas Delectat](http://forums.civfanatics.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=7358) by avain is a mod providing civ specific art for units and cities for all civilizations present in Beyond the Sword. 
In this module, I have adapted this feature to DoC and extended it to all new civilizations added here. 
In some cases, that means that a new civilization shares the art styles of an existing one: for example, Thailand shares the Khmer art styles. 
I have also changed several specific unit art types to better fit the context of this mod.

In addition, ethnic city styles are more dynamic in DoC, and besides civilization and era can also be determined by other factors such as present religions and previous owners. 
In particular, an algorithm is included that assigns appropriate city styles to independent cities based on their location.
